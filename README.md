# JavaScript Conflict with &lt;object&gt; Embedded Content

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to the interaction between JavaScript and embedded content using the &lt;object&gt; tag.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs when the embedded content (e.g., a PDF file containing JavaScript) interacts with the main HTML page's JavaScript. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including errors or unpredictable modifications to the page's DOM. Conflicts can arise from duplicate variable names or function names, leading to unexpected overwrites or behavior changes.

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe the unexpected behavior or errors (if any).

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing the interaction between the parent page's JavaScript and the embedded content's JavaScript, typically by using techniques such as namespaces to avoid naming collisions. The `solution.html` file demonstrates a possible solution to this problem.

## Note

This bug highlights the importance of considering potential conflicts when using embedded content in web pages, and the need for careful code management, especially concerning the use of namespaces to prevent naming clashes in JavaScript.
