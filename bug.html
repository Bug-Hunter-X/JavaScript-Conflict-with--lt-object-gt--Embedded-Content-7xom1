<p>This is an example of an uncommon HTML bug related to the use of the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag and its interaction with JavaScript.</p><p>The <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag is used to embed external content into an HTML page.  However, if the embedded content (e.g., a PDF or other multimedia file) attempts to interact with the JavaScript environment, it can lead to unexpected behavior or errors if not properly handled. This is especially true if the embedded content has its own JavaScript code that conflicts with the parent page's JavaScript.</p><pre><code>&lt;object data="mydocument.pdf" type="application/pdf"&gt;&lt;param name="scroll" value="yes"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</code></pre><p>A conflict can occur if the embedded document's JavaScript tries to manipulate elements within the parent page's DOM or uses variables and functions with the same names as those used in the parent page.  This can lead to unpredictable errors or page malfunctions.</p>
